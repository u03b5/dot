1. implement kademlia using the cool trick we learned
2. learn category theory and haskell very very well in depth
3. restart my pwn career; focus as of right now on binary analysis
  * this is so important in terms of pwn and i think ive overlooked this for so long
    a lot of time spent on pwn challenges is actually reversing the functionality of
    the binary. vulns are a lot easier to spot when you are able to analyze the
    program well. you will be: [pwn/rev]
4. compilers in depth!!

list of interesting mathematics:
  * category theory
  * recursion theory
  * simple type theory (church)
  * set theory
  * homotopy type theory
  * model theory
  * proof theory
  * algebra
    * algebra 1, 2 & complex numbers
  * group theory
  * combinatorics
  * number theory
  * abstract algebra
  * trigonometry
  * calculus
  * linear algebra

todo:
* fp, codewars, theory, types, esolang dev - 1 week
  * haskell, ocaml, lisp, coq, prolog, agda, verilog, rust, typescript, ARM
* algorithms, data structures, graphs, computability/complexity, SAT, parser, regex - 2 weeks
* compiler development, IR, optimization, code generation - 1 week
* operating system development
* build our own temple
* win32 rev/pwn, SAT/SMT, automatic xpl & fuzzing / binary analysis
  * reverse engineer malware
  * pwnable.tw, pwnable.kr, reversing.kr
  * crackmes.one, ctftime.org
* decompiler engine & reverse engineering framework development in C++
  * port engine to python
  * make good api and bindings for usage & porting to different translation engine
* develop a fuzzing framework

  * bittorrent client
  * custom blockchain
  * p2p marketplace
* vulnerability research
  * bug bounty & get paid. if we find something wormable, maybe think about saving it for our own
    malware. weight the pros and cons of both approaches, submit the vuln or use within our malware.
* linear algebra
* graphics programming, game engine development & game hacking
  * SVO & voxel engine
  * serialization of game object & designing efficient/secure network systems

* machine learning / data science
* hardware & computer engineering
* contribute to open source, write our own blog, make portfolio & host on vps
* ctf, win defcon ctf finals
* get a job you bum!
